# Community Leadership Summit X Playbook

### Vision

We want to improve the community managemente culture and bring it where communities are.

### Mission

Create a sustainable network of [CLSx events](http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/clsx/license/), aligned in objectives and culture. Because community management is a very wide field, the main but not exclusive focus is on offline and online tech community ecosystem. In any case, **all community leaders and members are welcome**, weâ€™re an open and inclusive community of practice. As per [CLSx licence](http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/clsx/license/), these event are non-profit events.

### How

We're moving along two main axis:

* Identify, connect and empower local groups or people to own and run CLSx events
* Support them making the organisation of these events as effortless as possible, so they can focus on the most important things: content and people. We wanna help with logistic \(venue, funding, communication templates, website, etc\), and connections useful to find speakers and attendees. The more, the better.
