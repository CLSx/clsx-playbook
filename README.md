# Community Leadership Summit X Playbook

### Vision

Craft the community leadership culture and bring it where communities are.

### Mission

Create a sustainable network of [CLSx events](http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/clsx/license/), aligned in objectives and culture. Because community management is a very wide field, the main but not exclusive focus is on offline and online tech community ecosystem. In any case, **all community leaders and members are welcome**, weâ€™re an open and inclusive Community of Practice. As per [CLSx licence](http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/clsx/license/), these event are non-profit events.

### How

We're moving along two main axis:

* Identify, connect and empower local groups or people to own and run CLSx events
* Support them making the organisation of these events as effortless as possible, so they can focus on the most important things: content and people. We wanna help defining [best practices to organise an event](clsx-in-a-box.md), providing ready-to-use [communication templates](/comms-template.md), a website template, creative assets etc. So this book.

### Who

[Jono Bacon](http://www.jonobacon.org/) create the first Community Leadership Summit event back in 2012, and the CLSx event licence. [Alfredo Morresi](http://www.rainbowbreeze.it/) and [Alessio Fattorini](https://it.linkedin.com/in/alefattorini) are helping growing the movement in Europe. And, most important, there is the **network of volunteers** that are organising [CLSx events all around the globe](/past-clsx-events.md). 

### What's next

Well, everything depends on you: if you wanna help us crafting the community leadership culture, and you think you have 40/50 people potentially interested in partecipatpotential attendees organize a CLSx event, follow our list of best practice \(but feel free to innovate\),
