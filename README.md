# Community Leadership Summit X Playbook
Everything you need to know about CLSx events

## Goals
We want to foster the spreading of knowledge on community management topics. The way we've chosen is to create a sustainable network of [CLSx events](http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/clsx/license/) in Europe, aligned in objectives and culture.
## Target
Although community management is a wide and very horizontal field, we would like to focus primarily on offline and online tech community leaders, and then on the rest of the community ecosystem. In any case, **all community leaders and members are welcome**, we’re an open and inclusive community of practice :)

Next Steps
Set an owner and an expected completion time for all the next steps
Create a network of community managers leader in Europe, spread the voice about the CLSWorld initiative and evaluate their interest in supporting the idea / organising local events / improve the CLSWorld plan
Gather all the contacts that we have in a common place
Create a communication template to talk about the CLSWorld initiative, their potential involvements and call to actions
Contact the relevant people and start the discussion
Make the organization of new CLSx events as quicker and smoother as possible
Create a CLSx-event-in-a-box guide, gathering the experience of previously organized CLSx events around the world, in order to make easier and smoother the organization of a new CLSx events.
Open discussion channels with global actors like Google, Mozilla, Microsoft etc, so they could provide sponsorship and collaboration support to the local CLSx events as part as a global agreement, avoiding the overload to create these channels from scratch and for every CLSx event.
Add CLSx events to global community events calendar, like https://www.communityroundtable.com/community-101/resources/community-management-events-calendar/ 
Create a unified communication platform for CLSWorld to allow discussion on community management topics, coordination of local events organization and fun :)
Unify the Slack channel under the CLSWorld domain, and open country/language subchannels, plus a channel for content sharing and general discussions. New channels will be created based on requests
Create a CLSWorld Reddit channel
Create a “blogroll-style” gather of with interesting content on community management, maybe using IFTTT agents and other tools
