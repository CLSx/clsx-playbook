# Community Leadership Summit Meetup

What if the local context doesn't have enough people (more that 40/50) interested to come and join a CLSx event? No worry, a valid alternative could be start a Community Leadership Meetup

### Scope of the meetup
Exactly the same of the main mission: create an open and inclusive Community of Practice to craft the community leadership culture, with a main but not exclusive focus on offline and online tech community ecosystem, but where all community leaders and members are welcome.
