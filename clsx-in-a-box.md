# CLSx event-in-a-box guide
So, you want to organise a CLSx event in your city / country. Well done, and if you want, we're here to help you.
This document gather the experience of past CLSx events, to make easier to organise the next ones. Of course everything is a suggestion, and what local organisers have the final word on everything. 

### Profile of a typical CLSx event
We've seen good results using a one day format, with frontal sessions (1:many) in the morning, an unconference part in the afternoon and different breaks for networking. They all work well together because the morning sessions warm up attendees a provide an initial framework for discussion, networking breaks allow people to get in touch each other and create a collaborative clima and both of them create a good ground for the unconference part, where people are more open to discuss, share and talk each other.

### Attendees
As per the main mission, CLSx events targets mainly, but not exclusively, offline and online tech community leaders, and roles involved in community management. In any case, **all community leaders and members are welcome**.

### Prerequisites
In order to organise a typical CLSx event, several elements should be put in place:
 * Around 40/50 potential attendees. With less, we've seen the unconference session may be less effective. If less that this number, an alternative to consider is to start organising a [Community Leadership Meetup](meetup.md), and once the interest reach the above bar, organise a CLSx event
 * A venue with one main space able to host the entire audience for the plenary sessions, plus additional rooms for the unconference sessions. Of course the same room can be split to host two or more unconference sessions, but please consider the noise if rooms are small and discussion groups are near
 * A website to gather information about the event, like date, location, agenda, sponsor etc. A [template](site-template.md) is in progress
